I am a recent ALX Africa graduate [24/01/2025] who specializes in back-end web development. My broad range of abilities includes an understanding of Google Workspace Suite and Microsoft Office and a solid grounding in web principles using Python, SQL, Django, and the Django REST Framework, as well as HTML, CSS, Git, and GitHub.

I'm working hard to improve my technical skills in key programming tech sectors. I'm also committed to learning about software development life cycles and adding clear, effective code to codebases. I'm dedicated to continuous improvement, flexibility, and keeping up with emerging technology and trends in the industry. I'm constantly looking for opportunities to work with professionals who share my enthusiasm for innovation and excellence.
